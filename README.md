# Notes
A collection of my notes from various classes, events, etc. Organized by year. I use [HackMD](HackMD.io) to write markdown notes. It's great, but I think I'll transition to an offline version of HackMD. Will update when I figure that out.

~~also, please ignore any spelling errors. I typed a lot of these notes out very quickly~~
