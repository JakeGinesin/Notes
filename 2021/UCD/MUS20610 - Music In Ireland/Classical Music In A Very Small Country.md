# Lect 4, Classical Music In a Very Small Country

## What is Classical Music?

- Classical Music - Art Music - 'European' Art Music
- Classical Msuic - the opposite of light or popular music; gnerally regarded as having permanet rather than ephermeral value; music that is written down and that takes a more or less establishe form to transmit some sor tof artistic expression; often used in contradisction to 'folk' and 'popular' music
- music as enterainment vs music as aestheric force
- what is music for?

## Ireland: Traditional vs Classical dichotomy
- Idea that there was/is no tradition of Classical msuic in Irleand - an extreme example of this view in Sean O Raida's interview to Danish TV in 1970
- Also, O Raida's statement in 'Our Musical Heritage' (RTE Radio) that 'there is nothing European about Irish music' - extreme nationalist view also coloured by Irish exceptionalism

## Historiography of the Irish Musical Tradition
- Oxford Music Online/New Grove article on Irleand is divided into two parts: 1. Art Music; 2. Traditional Musi (Nicholas Carolan)
- Note how both authors try to calim the harp for 'Art Music' and for 'Traditional Music'
- The harp was an instrument of the elit etradition until c.1600. There was nothing 'popular' about it
- The use of categories such as 'Art' or 'Traditional/Folk' deeply problematic and anacronistic whne applied to music pre-1750
- W. H. Grattan Flood, A Hiusotry of Irish Music (Dublin, 1905) - Contains some outlandish claims on the 'Irishness' of carious NEglish Composers

## Classical Music Needs an Infrastucture
- Institutions
- Patronage
- Training/Education
- Effort at appreciation
- Moves beyond 'music as mere entertainment'
- Economic and social milieu that is conductive to its developemtn and flourishing

## Historiography of Irish Music should consider..
- Demography = Ireland is very smol
    - 1840s = 8.1 mil
    - 1900 = 3.2 mil
    - 1961 = 2.8 mil
    - 2021 = 4.8 mil
- Population of Dublin:
    - 1700 = 60,000
    - 1800 = 200,000 (6th largest in euro)
    - 1900 = 400,000 (Dublin did not keep pac ewith other cities in 19th century)
    - 2020 = City = 550,000; Urban Area = 1.2 Million; Greater Dublin Area = 2 Million

## Historiography of Irish Music should consider...
- Economics
    - Historically, Ireland with a smaller population and territory was poorer econmically than England, France, Spain, etc.
    - Distribution of welth confined to a s,all elite along ethnic and religious lines
    - After the Act of Union (1800), Dublin ceased to be a capital city and became a provicinal British city, flight of capital, flight of talent
    - Little industrialization during the 19th century with the exception of Belfast
    - 19th Century - Catholic emancipation -rowth of educated Catholic Middle class
    - None of the visible wealth that the industrial Revolution brought to other cities and regions. Think of the great City/'Town Halls' of Liverpoor, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds
    - Ireland 1900 - 1922 - Economy comparable to Denmark and other small European states

## A quick tour through very small country
- Medieval Ireland - earliest notated musical source from c.1150 with evidence of english and continental European influences, including polyphony and latest style of muiscal notation
- 15th century/early-16th century - Maynooth Castle - Earls of Kildare, Geaoid Mor, etc
- 18th Century Dublin, The beggar's opera, G.F Handel - Messiah, Etc.
