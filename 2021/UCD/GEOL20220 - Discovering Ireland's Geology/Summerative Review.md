# Discovering Ireland's Geography Summerative Review

> [Here's a vocab quizlet if you're interested](https://quizlet.com/646596128/geology-flash-cards/?x=1qqt)

> Also I apologize for all the spelling errors D:

## Exercise 1 - Intro Stuff

- Stratograph: Ages of different types of rocks
- The ancient rocks are at the ***top* of Ireland**
- Scale bar compares the map size to reality size
- Ireland is mostly made up of limestone (calcium carbonate, CACO3) and some clay
- Geological Cross Sections = they're a graphic represenation of the intersection of geological bodies

### Sedimentary Vs Metamorphic vs Igneous

- Sedimentary rocks are made up of sediment
- metamorphic rocks are sedimentary rocks that have been molded by pressure and heat
- igneous rocks have been cast from really hot liquidy shit

### Faults

A fault is where a rock is broken and where it is moved

![](https://i.imgur.com/RGmFoXk.png)

Three types of faults:
- Normal Fault - (extended crust. total width of whole structure increases. one side increases in height) We know because the "hanging wall" has come down
- Reverse fault (compressed crust. total width is reduced) we know because hanging wall is moved up
- Wrench/Strike slip fault (horizontal motion. shear motion)

> San Andreas fault is a large strike slip fault :O

### Dip VS Strike

![](https://i.imgur.com/dXd8P31.png)

### Types of folds

- Undefomed Layers, the young is higher than old
- Anticline
- Syncline
![](https://i.imgur.com/0aASQQJ.png)

Anticline and Syncline tend to occur together!
![](https://i.imgur.com/H1bfEhs.png)

Can be in a large or small scale

## Exercise 2 - Determining the age of rocks and fossils

### What are the 3 approaches for dating rocks?

- Relative Dating - determines the dates of geologic units in a relative sense
- Absolute Dating - provides an actual date in millions of years based on something like raidometric decay of unstable isotopes
- Magnetic Dating - noting the numeric ages of reversalsof the earth's magnetic field

### Radiometric Absolute Dating

What are the main materials used?
- Uranium-Lead
- Rubidum-Strontium
- Thorium-Potassium

We can use U-Pb or K-AR dating since the half-lives of Uranium and Potassium allows for vety old ages to be estimated

*Note:* radiometric dating has inherent uncertainties and dates are therefore shown as X+-Y

#### Half Lives:

the number of radioactive atoms after time *t* can be given by:

$$
N = N_0e^{-λt}
$$

λ can be determined by:

$$
λ = \frac{\ln(2)}{t^{1/2}} 
$$

Half life isotopes commonly used for radiometric dating of geological materials:
- Uranium-238 - 4.5 billion years
- Uranium-235 - 704 million years
- Thorium-232 - 14 billion years
- Rubidium-87 - 48.8 billion years
- Potassium-40 - 1.25 billion years
- Samarium-147 - 106 billion years

Carbon 14 dating is like the radiometric dating, but shitty
**^14C has a half life of about ~5,730 years**

What assumptions must be made about absolute dating?
- Nothing has altered the amount of parent and daughter isotopes in the rock through time
- that no daughter isotopes existed at time zero
- the decay constant is indee da constant and does not vary through time due to external factors
- parents and daughter can be accurately measured

### Relative Dating

Will determine the dates of geologic units in a *relative sense* (woah one rock is older than another rock)

We use:
- *principle of superposition*: in an undeformed sequence, the oldest rocks are at the bottom
- *principle of original horizontally*: layers of sediment are orignally deposited under the action of gravity (top down)
- *princple of cross cutting*: Any geologic feature that cross-cuts across strata must have formed after the rocks they cut through were deposited
- *principle of daunal succession*: Fossil species succeed each other in a definite, recognizable order and once a species goes extinct, it disappears and cannot reappear in younger rocks

### Uncomformaties 

These are gaps in time. An uncomformity is the contact or surface between two adjacent geological units where there is a break in the "temporal" (geological kinda sorta) record

Types of uncomformaties:
- *Angular Uncomformaties*: Separates strata of different times with different structural operations where there is an angular relationship between the underlying and overlying stratigraphy
- *Disconformity*: Separates upper and lower strata of different times but with the same structural orientation without evidence of tilting of the underlyling strata. Way more difficult to recognize
- *Nonconformity*: Separates sedimentary rocks from igneous rock or metamorphic rock. this relationship usually indicates a period of long-term uplift, weatering, and erosion in order to expose the older, deeper rocks

Angular uncomformaties:
![](https://i.imgur.com/IoijCGQ.png)
Different angles :D

## Exercise 3 - Ages and rock types on the island of Ireland

- By definition, nearly all rocks are made of minerals and most rocks consist of different types of minerals

- Euhedral, Subhedral, Anhedral to descirbe crystals that have well developed faces
![](https://i.imgur.com/Eazfdrj.png)

- Some common minerals in the field classes include quartz, orthoclase, feldspar, plagioclase feldspar, biotite mica, muscovite mica, and calcite

![](https://i.imgur.com/b9RxlrV.png)




### Different Characteristics of minerals used for identification

- Color
    - Although, colors can tend to vary in one mineral. Important, but not indicitive
- Transparency
    - Can be transparent, translucent (light partly passes thru), opaque (no light passes through)
- Lustre 
    - used to describe the amount and quality of light reflected from the material
    - different types:

![](https://i.imgur.com/PYTgGXR.png)

- Cleavage and Fracture - a crystallographic plane along which a mineral breaks easily. The mineral will tend to break a certain way
- Hardness - The scratch hardness of minearls is measured relative to the Mohs Hardness Scale
    - Comprised of 10 minerals
        - Talk - 1
        - Gypsum - 2
        - Calcite - 3
        - Fluorite - 4
        - Apatite - 5
        - Orthoclase - 6
        - Quartz - 7
        - Topaz - 8
        - Corundum - 9
        - Diamond - 10
- Streak - The color of powder that it leaves behind if scratched
- Habit - simply the shape of the crystals

![](https://i.imgur.com/Xtn9lkn.png)

- Reaction of carbonate mineals with dilute hydrochoric acid - most minerals show no visible reaction when dilute (10%) HCL is applied, but som ecarbonate minerals react by producing carbon dioxie gas. Visible as tiny bubbles
- Deflection of a magnetic compass - a compass needle is magnetised and will attract iron. A few minerals are attracted this way, i.e. they're magnetic 

### Solid solutions

What is a solid solution? A solid solution describes a family of materials which have a range of compositions but a single crystal structure

### Rock Cycle

There's a general rock cycle that exists:
![](https://i.imgur.com/dtoKNqp.png)

### Rock Classification

![](https://i.imgur.com/RWiIqqb.png)

### Definitions fo rIgneous, Sedimentary, and Metamorphic

- **Igneous**: composed of material crystlas fomre dby the cooling and crystallisation of molten magma (sometimes called a "melt") in the subsurface or lavas on the surface
- **Sedimentary**: composed of material deposited or formed at the Earth's surface inclduing eroded sediment, fossils, and chemical precipitates
- **Metamorphic**: an ignoeus or sedimentary rock whose composition and/or texture has been changed due to heat and/or pressure in the subsurface

### What features help distinquish of a rock is igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic?

- **Ignoeus**: Fresh crystals that are interlocking of minerals stable under pressures and tempatures higher than surface conditions
- **Sedimentary**: Fossils, mineral grains that have been weathered/transported, structures associated with wind or water movement, biological activity, minerals formed from precipitation out of seawater (i.e. calcium carbonate, salt, etc)
- **Metamorphic**: can be difficult. Particular fabrics or minerals that form when sedimentary or ignoeus parent rocks experience elevated pressures or tempatures (e.g. kyanite).

### Where are rocks in Ireland?

![](https://i.imgur.com/SChsDZL.png)

The rocks in the north, northwest, and south east are the oldest. They date back to the precambrian age. They're about 1.7 billion years old

![](https://i.imgur.com/5PuYlTQ.png)

It's also worth noting that Ireland has a larger proportion of palazoic rock, the limestone.

Where are igneous rocks tho?
![](https://i.imgur.com/eMa2Wte.png)

## Exercise 4 - Plate Tectonics and Ireland's Modern Geodynamic Setting

some Q/A:

- How many plates are there on earth?:
    - 7 major plates, with a bunch of microplates

![](https://i.imgur.com/wuPWAmI.png)

- What name is given to a plate boundary where crust is made?
    - Constructive plate boundary (also called divergent plate boundary). Divergent plate boundary will cause hot stuff to come up!
- What is destroyed at a subduction zone?
    - Oceanic crust/ oceanic plate
- WHat type of plate boundary runs through califironia?
    - Transform plate boundary (also called strike slip)
- What Drives plate movement?
    - There are a number of theories!
        - Mantle convection - here currents in the mantle carry the plates along like a conveyor belt
    - Ridge push - where newly formed curst in the mid ocean ridge that are warmer and are at a higher elevation pushes the colder crust away from the ridge
    - Slab pull - where sinking (subducting) cold dense oceanic crust pulls the crust it is attached to along behind it. This mechanism is said to be important

![](https://i.imgur.com/Oth44D8.png)

### Crustal Thickness

There's oceanic crust, which is tinner. Then there's thicker continental crust

![](https://i.imgur.com/f0DXgcz.png)

Oceanic crust and continental crust are made up of different stuff. 

### Magnetic Anomoly data

![](https://i.imgur.com/tYx4Oa2.png)

We can see every time the poles shift by analyzing the lattices of crystals. Magnetic anomoly dating

- We can gague from this that the oceanic crust is significantly younger than continentnal crust

### Heat Flow 

![](https://i.imgur.com/rKVqo4w.png)

Heat flow at the mid ocean ridge is high. As we move away from the ridge, we get lower and lower heat flow

Oceanic crust ages tell us that new, hot crust is being forme din the middle of the atlentic and at the mid ocena ridge. It's spreading away from the ridge. 

If we play this process back in time, we can see that the continents fit together as famously proposed by Wegener based on the shapes of the continents

The magnetic stripes are formed by changes in the polarity of Earth's magnetic field. Since the seafloor spreads away from the ridge we get the same record on either side 

> The atlantic coean has not always existed but has opened up over a long period of time 

### Subduction Zones

![](https://i.imgur.com/yUGk24v.png)

They're the cause of reaaaally deep ocean trenches

## Exercise 5 - Plate tectonic evolution 1: the breakup of pangea (200-0 ma)

- 200 million years ago, ireland was chillin in the center of pangea. Ireland was just above 30 degrees latitiude
- Pangea consists of two supercontinents :O
- Ireland specifically shifted northwest from pangea-age to nowadays

### What Broke Pangea Up?

- Two different processes to explain rifting:
    - Horizontal extensional fiorces due to slab pull acting at th elateral boundaries of the system. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/wsmlihU.png)

### Continental Drift Evidence

- Africa and South America show an obvious fit :O wow so cool. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/6Cy5oeI.png)

- Mountain belts occasionally end abruptly at the continental margins have similar ages

### Paleomagnetism

- We have considered paleomagnetism in previous exercises in term sof magnetic polarity reverals which have been used to help date rokcsand understand the formation of oceanic crust.
- The paleomagnetism of minerals is alos used to calculate the paleolatitude at which minerals formed or were deposited and this tells us where the continents were in the past

Using the magnetic structures of minerals, we can determine location

The angle of inclination of the geomagnetic field changes systematically iwth latitude and changes uniformly to form O^o at the magnetic equator to 90^o at the magnetic poles.

We can apply this technique to minerals in ingneous rocks rock magnetic minerals. We can also apply it to sedimentary rocks contiaining very fine grained magnetic mineral grains (< 10 microns) since as a fine magnetic grain settles through the water column, the magnetic moment of the grain tends to rotate to become parallel to the Earth's magnetic field. 

*Note*: it is not possible to determine the paleolongitude using inclination since it is the same at all longitudes. Hot spots however cna be used to inform us about latitudinal movements of plates but these only go bac ~130 my

#### Calculting...

The palaeolatitude, lambda, is calculated using the equation:

$$
\tan I = 2\tan\lambda
$$

#### Potential Errors with this technique

- The following owuld cause errors in the claculation:
    - if strata have been tilted form their organic position at the time of solidifcation for example due to folding. This can be accounted for if the dip and strike of thie unit is known
    - If the original magnetism has been destroyed and replaced by a new magnetic orientation >This can occur for example in regions with high heat flow or strong tectonic deformation
    - If the earth's magnetic field isnot the same as today - the magnetic fole has wandered and reversed through time. This must be taken into account by additional corrections
    - We must also assume that the sample has been collected correctly with its present orientation relative to today's magnetic and horizontal recorded
    
### Continental Collision (India)
- India used to be apart of southern pangea, but it went *vroom* into asia, making a ton of mountains. 
- It traveled at around ~67 km/my or 6cm/year
    - this is blazing fast apparently, hence the mountains in the collision zone being so dam big

## Exericse 6 - Plate Tectonic Evolution 2, Electric Boogaloo: The formation of Pangea

- This takes place before 200 million years ago

### What'd everything look like during the early silurian period?

- Principle continents are:
    - Southern super continent of Gondwana (present day south america, australia, new zealand, southeastern USA, Arabia, Southern Europe, India)
    - Suberia
    - Baltica (Scandanavia, eastern Russia, Northern Europe)
    - Laurentia (most of present-day North America)
- The microcontinent of Avalonia is also shown since it is important to the Ireland-UK story. 
- Principle Oceans are:
    - Pathalassic Ocean
    - Rheic Ocean
    - Lapetus Ocean
- Ireland and the UK are split by the lapetus ocean. Southern Ireland, England, and Wales form part of Avalonia and northern Ireland/Scottland part of Laurentia

> Here are some pictures

![](https://i.imgur.com/GSvrNCC.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/POlXFIl.png)

### How did everything move about during the silurian era?

#### Oceans:
- From the late Cambian to early Silurian periods, the lapetus Ocean closed 
    - At the same time, the Rheic Ocean opened (between Gondwana and Avalonia)
- The Lapetus Oceanic crust is being destroyed by subduction whilst Rheic ocean crust is being formed

#### Avalonia-specific:
- Avalonia forms by breaking (rifting) away from Gondwana in the cambrian

Rifting looks like this btw:
![](https://i.imgur.com/YAf4RP7.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/H2DxsfY.png)

> There's a rift opening in Kenya rn

- It drifts northwards from ~80 degrees S to about ~35 degrees S (latitude ofc) from the late cambrian to the early silurian
- Laurentia also drifts northwards but  not as fast as Avalonia and drifts eastwards
- The overall motion of Laurntia is towards the east and slightly to the north

![](https://i.imgur.com/QV3KvqZ.png)
(Late Cambrian (left) and Early Ordovician (right) palaeogeography showing the breaking away of avalonia from Gondwana)

#### Island Arc Collision

![](https://i.imgur.com/6Nmn0ib.png)

- The island arc collides with Laurentia. The collisional event is an early phase of the Caledonian orogeny known as the *Grampian phase* and invovled obduction of oceanic material onto the contiental crust
- Before collision, the island arc was formed by subduction of lapetus oceanic crust

Here's a nice diagram of subduction:

![](https://i.imgur.com/6mNCv3e.png)

Keep in mind those volcanos from the subduction could be used to create land n stuff when in an ocean

### What happens during the Late Silurian?
> This is important for geological history of Ireland/UK

- The lapetus Ocean closes due to a continued subduction and collision between three contients of Avalonia, Laurentia, and Baltica

![](https://i.imgur.com/dY4h2ao.png)

- This is responsible for the appalation mountains

### Precambrian Rocks in Modern Day

![](https://i.imgur.com/STvBbX7.png)

- There are two distinct areas of Precambrian rocks which studies have shown are distinct in terms of their geological histories.
- These two precambrian "terranes" can be traced eastwards to scotland and wales
- 

## Exercise 7 - Ireland's changing climate through time

> How do surface temperature vary with latitude and longitude?

The angle of incoming solar radiatio influences seasonal temperatures of locations at different latitudes. When the sun's rays strike earth's surface near the equator, the incoming solar radiation is more direct (closer to perpendicular) therefore temperatures are higher

### Climactic Regions

Due to atmospheric circulation systems that form a series of three cells from the equator to poles, different areas are generally warmer while others are cooler - despite latitudes implying otherwise

![](https://i.imgur.com/DSuTNN0.png)

Warm, wet air moves up and then comes down as cool, dry air.

![](https://i.imgur.com/8oomZdL.png)

It's worth noting that the warmer water bodies cause europe to be much warmer than canada - despite the two being similar latitudes. 

#### How does the Himalaya affect India?

Areas of high elevation such as the major mountain belts and elevated plateus (tibet) distrupt the climactic zones forming cooler regions at latitudes usally associated with warmer climates. 

Tibet has a pretty cold limate with an average annual temp of ~1 degree C. 

The Himalaya also strongly effects precipitation patterns. Monsoonal moist air coming from the Indian Ocean are force dupwards by the Himalayas losing their moisture by precipitation as the air mass cools.

The himilayas therefore act to block moist air moving northwards, forming an extensive rain shadow in tibet, mongolia, and china. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/nvCPxZ7.png)

### What are the factors affecting Earth's climate?

- Solar Insulation - amount of solar radiation a given area recieved. is a function of latitude 
- Atmospheric Circulation
- Elevation - (and its effets on the surrounding areas)
- Oceanic Currents - an important agent for transporting heat around the planet and sea surface temperatures affecting the climate of neighboring lands

### Paleoenvironmental indicators

> aka: indicators of past climates

**Coals**: Rocks with a high proportion of organic plant matter that require low oxygen. these are usually formed in waterlogged areas such as swamps and bogs for their preservation

**Bauxites**: iron-aluminum rich rocks formed from reddish clay leached soils (laterites) indicating intensive prolonged weathering in tropical or subtropical regions

**Evaporites (salt & gypsum)**: mineral deposits formed by the evaporation of seawater or high salinity lakes indicating arid environments

**Calcretes**: Accumulations of terrestrial calcium carbonate (same stuff as limestone) within soils due to shallow groundwater being saturated. This indicates moisture-deficient environments

**Kaolinites**: White rocks made out of a high proportion of kaolin clay materials derived from the breakdown of feldspar and muscovite in granite and rhyolite. This indicates conditions of hgih rainfall, moderate to high temps above the water table

**Tillites**: Sediments transported and desposited by glacier ice with little or no sorting by water. Often composed of a wide range of grain sizes

**Glendonites**: A type of concentration whihc is a product of calcium carbonte mineral called ikaite. It forms at low temps close to the freezing point of water, indicating glaciomarine or cold deepwater settings

**Dropstones**: Sediment dropped by floating ice onto the sea floor, including large bounders

**Reef**: Reefs typically occured in predominantly tropical/subtropical regions

### Icehouse vs Greenhouse conditions

Earth'sglobal temp has fluctuated substantially through time, leading to periods when the earth is relatively warm and periods where it was relatively cold

**Hothouse/Greenhouse**: lack of continental ice sheets: high levels of carbon dioxide, water, and methane. Sea surface temps are around 28c to 0c (equator to pole)

**Icehouse Earth** occurs when there is a long-term decrease in termperatures on Earth's surface and atmosphere. This leads to polar ice caps and continental ice sheets. These periods are associated with lower levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. During icehouse conditions, "glacials" and warmer "interglacials" occur on the order of tens to hundreds of thousands of years.

We are currently in an icehouse earth - specifically an interglacial period. 

### Ireland's changing climate

![](https://i.imgur.com/c3zfppP.png)

## Exercise 8: Quaternary Ice Ages and Its effects on Ireland

In the vid, the dude mentioned these topics are important:
> When the tertiary ice house began
> What glacial-interglacial cycles are and hwo temperature, sea level, and CO_2 varies during cycles
> The pattern of growth of the last eurasian ice sheet an dhow Irish-British shoreline vaired
> How the extent and transport direction if ice sheets may be determined from glacial features

### Present Ice House

When did the polar ice caps associated with the present icehouse form in the southern and northern hemespheres?
- The antartic ice sheep appeared 40-45 million years ago. 

Long term global cooling through the tertiary is related to reducing atmospheric CO2

Glaciation was also faciitated b the occurance of land masses at the poles meaning that polar regions could not be warmed by oceanic currents

#### After polar ice caps formed, did they stay the same or vary through the Quaternary? 

Ice caps advanced and retreated in repsonse to high frequency variations in earth's surface temperature. These define glacial (cold) and interglacial (warm) periods lasting thousands to tens of thousands of years



#### Sea Level VS CO2 Levels

![](https://i.imgur.com/Yn5bPF8.png)

There's a pretty good correleation! Temperature is related to these as well - and follows a similar pattern. 

### What causes glacial-interglacial cycles?

There are a couple factors, including:
- Eccentricity of Earth's orbit (has a periodocity of 100,000 years)
- Changes in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
- Increase in radiation

### Eurasian Ice Sheet

Many of the glacial landforms we see in Ireland are related to the most recent glaciations over the last 500,000 years.

The most recent glacial cycle occurred between ~37,000 and 10,000 years ago. Below is an image of the inferred northern polar ice cap at 19,000 years. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/S6aauvq.png)

Covering lots of north america, lots of europe. etc. 

#### What was the pattern of growth?

![](https://i.imgur.com/MeCEz0v.png)

There are specific nucleation points where the glaciers started growing. 

### Glacial Geomorphology

What can we see today that are clearly remnants of the glacier period?

U-Shaped and V-Shaped valleys are clearly eroded from glaciers:

![](https://i.imgur.com/uN7sCL4.png)

Glacial Islands of the tops of ridges, mountains, orpeaks not covred with ice or snow within or at the edge of an ice sheet/glacier

![](https://i.imgur.com/Lorpu0e.png)

Roches Mountonness are bumps or hills of bedrock with an asymmetric shape in the form of a gently sloping and abraded upglacier face and a quarried down glacier face that is typically blunter
![](https://i.imgur.com/upXQ73g.png)

We can also see debris from glaciers:
![](https://i.imgur.com/vhVnuY1.png)

There are also subglacial stream deposits that form long sinuous elongate ridges of sand and gravel
![](https://i.imgur.com/CoyGl9F.png)

### BRITICE map

![](https://i.imgur.com/VKaniWi.png)

Accumulations of glacial sediment called moraines that form large areas on the current continental shelf are visible today

![](https://i.imgur.com/mRYCNeZ.png)

There are some other features that can help us determine direction: 

(keep in mind the direction is ->)
