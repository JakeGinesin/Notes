# Lect 1, General Intro

## Course basics

### Lectures

- Every Monday @ 11am & Wednesday @ 12pm
- 50% Cell Bio
- 50% Genetics
- Based on Campbell Biology book, 12th Global Edition

### Lab Practicals

- bi-weekly on Monday (@3pm for ~3 hrs) starting oct 4th
- **Always** bring a lab coat (can buy it in the student union shop)

### Homework
- Online Assignments
- Mastering Biology System

## Notes

### Personal Notes abt lecture
- Probably want to dive back into chem and connect info back to that
- I need to focus on connecting information/vocab together or I am going to get fucked in this class
- Learning structure: no direct notes in class outside vocab, take notes from ppt after

### Vocab I need to define
- Phospholipids (Phospholipid Bilayer) - Phosphorous and Lipids
- Ampipathic molecules - Molecules containing both polar and nonpolar portions in their stucture
- Hydrophobicity - Shit that doesn't like water
- Sugar Side Chain - Proteins containing glycans. Glycans are polymers made by living organisms. A polymer is a large molecule, typically organic
- Fatty Acids - Fatty acid bois
- Integral Proteins - Proteins embedded into the phospholipid bilayer
- Peripheral Proteins - Proteins on one side of the membrane
- Plasma membrane - Literally another word for membrane
- Bilayer - Two layers (of typically phospholipids)
- Drifting *laterally* - When phospholipids switch shapes
- Fluid Mosaic Model - Phospholipids switching places horizontally like super fast
- "Mosaic of protiens" - Different from mosaic protein i think. Mosaic protein means a protein that can do different things. A Mosaic of proteins seems like a group of proteins that can do different stuff
- Facilitated Diffusion vs regular diffusion - One is active and against the gradient usually and one is passive
- Gradient - Different pressures of a substance between membranes
- ATP - The stuff cells use for energy
- Aquaporins - Stuff that transports h20 across mebrane
- Catalysts - A substance that increaes te rate of a chemical reaction
- Substrate - the resulting chemical in a chemical reaction
- Glycoproteins - same thing as "sugar side chain"
- Human Leukocyte antigen (HLA) - a thing in humans that regualtes immune responses
- Endo/exo cytosis - shit moving in and out of the cell
- Phagocytosis - eating stuff for food



<!-- ## Actual notes

### What is cell bio?

- It's a branch that studies the structure, function, and behavior of cells
- Encompases both prokaryotic (unicellular) and eukaryotic (multicellular) organisms
- Encompases:
    - Cell metabolism
    - Cell communication
    - Cell cycle
    - Cell biochem
    - Cell Composition
