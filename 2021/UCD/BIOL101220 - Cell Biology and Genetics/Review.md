# Biology Summerative Review

## Cell Membrane

### Plasma Membrane
- It's a boundary separating the cell from the outside
- It responds to the environmental changes
- It consists of phospholipids and proteins
- Its functions include:
    - Transport
    - Cell-cell communication

Phospholipid Bilayer:
![](https://i.imgur.com/QL8Q8ZH.png)

> What is a phospholipid? It's a phosphorous attached to lipids

> Phosphorous stuff has polar atoms, meaning they're charged in some way. Therefore, they bond with water

The phospholipids are built in a *fluid mosaic model*, meaning:
- phospholipids move within bilayer, mostly drifting horizontally but sometimes drifting vertically
- Lateral movements occur **10^7 times a second**. 
- Horizontal movements occur about once a month

Why is this fluidity important? 
- Membranes must remain "fluid" (moving) to remain biologically active (alive)

> Unsaturated hydrocarbon lipid tales (meaning no water attached to the lipid), they'll remain active at lower temperatures 

> A mix of unsaturated and saturated hydrocarbons ensures things are stable and flexible at different temperatures

Cholesterol helps stabilize things in the phospholipid bilayer. It's like a buffer, hindering membrane solidification at low temps, and prevents fluidity at high temps

### Plasma Membrane Proteins

Keep in mind the plasma membrane is a mosaic of proteins dispersed within bilayer, with any hydrophilic regions exposed to water

Keep in mind, proteins have functions :O

### Types of Transport

#### Passive Transport 

![](https://i.imgur.com/EXjbKXh.png)

Issa like a tube :D

- Passive transport moves things from high to low concentrations (pressures)
- No ATM required 

#### Active Transport

![](https://i.imgur.com/yD4G7w6.png)

Issa like a clam or som lol

- Against concentration gradient (low to high pressure)
- Requires ATP

### Specific Types of Proteins

#### Transport Proteins

![](https://i.imgur.com/GLGdseT.png)

- They span the bi-layer
- They may provide hydrophilic channel (they have water)
- Likes some solutes

Aquaproteins:
- They transport protons
- They move water in and out
- These are newly discovered, back in '02

#### Membrane Enzyme Proteins

![](https://i.imgur.com/PgcO2Uj.png)

- Spans Bilayer
- Lowers activatio cost of reaction through providing catalyst that speed processes up
- Highly specific to substate (input something specific, something specific comes out)
- Changes the subtate into catalyst so it's reactive

#### Membrane Reactor Proteins

![](https://i.imgur.com/0E1IVTK.png)

- Spans the bi-layer
- Specific receptor (input) changes shape of protein, sending message into the cell

#### Glycoproteins

![](https://i.imgur.com/CSHsNvv.png)

- Identification tags for the cell
- Recognixe by proteins of other cells
- Can attach to other cells/environment

### Trans Membrane Transport

- Endocytosis => transport into the cell
- Exocytosis => transport out of the cell

> Note: Vescicle (membrane bound sphere) moves through and transports stuff
 
 - Phagocytosis: Using cell-membrane to nom something on the outside

## Nucleus

### Nucleus Basics

There are 3 main nucleus functions: Storage, Gene exprssion control, and regulation of protein synthesis

> Storage meaning the maintenance of genetic material
> Gene expression meaning control of DNA's exporting through managing transcription
> Regulation of protein synthesis meaning the synthesis of RNA, building ribosomes

The shape and structure:
![](https://i.imgur.com/tSzNp4D.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/xYNIBXF.png)

The nucleus mainly consist of:
- two lipid bilayer membane
    - Inner/outer membrane
        - Outer is continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER)
- Nuclear envelope has *pores* that allow stuff to move in between the cytosol (cytoplasm) and nucleus
- Intermediate filament proteins (lamines) form a structure caled the nuclear lamina
    - this lamina is like a structure-y thing
    - It's located on the inner area of the inner nuclear membrane

More abt the nuclear pores:
- transport materials (proteins, RNA, etc..) between nucleus & cytoplasm
- ~3000 pores per cell

> In more complex eukaryotes the envelope fizzles early in mitosis and reassembles later after the divison around the daughter chromosomes

Some more information:
- Nucleus is spherical or oval in shape
- The inner side of the nucleus is lined by nuclear lamina
- Lamin filaments maintain the nucleus's shape
- Nuclear lamina: a network of intermediate protein filaments - lamins and membrane proteins

Nuclear shape change => alteration in gene exposion

### Storage of Hereditary Info

DNA is structured in a double helix! 
*wow, this is so cool*

- DNA is organied into discrete units called chromosomes
    - Each chromosome is one loooong piece of DNA pretty much scrunched up
    - the DNA is scrunched up around proteins that help coil the DNA and package it within the nucleus
- DNA-Protein Complex is called Chromatin
- A gene is a length of DNA that codes for specific proteins

![](https://i.imgur.com/jkujcgE.png)

*What is Chromatin?*
- it's the material that makes up a chromosome
- Consists of DNA and Proteins
- Major Proteins: Histones (packaging elements for DNA)
- The chromatin condense DNA by wrapping and rewrapping DNA in a tight coil

### Nucleus

What is it? It's the site of RNA Synthesis, fRNA processing, and assembly of ribosome subunits

The size of the nucleus depends on the ribosome requiremnts for the type of cell

A larger nucleus is typical of cells that produce large amounts of proteins

### Ribosomes

- Ribosomal RNA and Protein Complexes
- Carry out protein synthesis
- High rates of protein synthesis - large numbers of ribosomes

2 Types:

- Free in the cytoplasm
- Bound to the ER

(1) Proteins made in free ribosomes function in the **cytoplasm**
(2) Proteins made in bound ribosomes - usually destined for insertion into membranes / organelles or for secretion (ready to be shuttled)

## Intro To Cell Biology

### What is cell biology?

- *Cell Biology* is a branch of biology what studies the structure, function, and behavior of cells
- *Cell Biology* encompasses both *prokaryotic* (unicellular) & *eukaryotic* (multicellular) organisms
>
- Cell biology can be divded itno many sub-disciplines, including:
    - Cell metabolism
    - Cell communication
    - Cell cycle 
    - Cell biochemistry
    - Cell composition

### Robert Hooke

What'd he do?

Initially using a microsophe, he first described plant-cell walls in slices of cork, describing them as "honey-comb" like structures

He also published *Micrographia*, coining the term "cell" to define those "walled boxes" that reminded him of the tiny rooms, or *cellula*, occupied by monks

### Classical Cell Theory (1838-1858)

- 1st Postulate - All Organisms are made of cells (Schwann, 1838-39)
- 2nd Postulate - Cells are the basic units of life 
- 3rd Postulate - Cells come from pre-existing cells that have multiplied (Virchow, 1858... 20 years later!)

### Modern Cell Theory

The "classical" theory was revisited as follows:

- 1st postulate: Cells contain heredity information in their DNA. this information is passed to new cells by cell division (molecular cell biology)
- 2nd postulate: All cells have the same chemical composition (cell biochemistry)
- 3rd postulate: Energy flow occurs within cells (Cell Metabolism)

## Cell Membrane (Structure and Function)

### Plasma Membrane

- It's a boundary separatin the living cell from the external environment
- It responds to changes in internal and external conditions
- Funcitons include (but not limited to): *Transport* and *cell-to-cell communication*

#### Structure:


It's defined by a phospholipid bilayer
![](https://i.imgur.com/DXsZPHN.png)

But what are phospholipids? They're amphipathic moleculues, containing both *hydrophobic* (water repelling) tails with *hydrophilic* (water loving/attracting) heads

![](https://i.imgur.com/AiXlNIv.png)

#### Integral Protein

Protein stably attached to the biological membrane, most commonly span the phospholipid pilayer, always in contact iwth hydrophobic part

#### Peripheral Proteins

Peripheral Proteins are proteins adhering only temporarily to the biological membrane, either attached to an integral protein or penetrated peripheral regions (but not the hydrophobic portion, the inside) of bilayer

### Fluid Mosaic Model of Plasma Membrane

- Phospholipids in the plasma membrane move within bilayer
- Most of the lipids (and some proteins) drift laterally

![](https://i.imgur.com/f3aA4jg.png)

- Membranes must be *fluid* to remain "biologically active"
- *Unsaturated Hydrocarbon lipid tails* allow the membrane to remain fluid at lower temparatures
- *Cholesterol* stabilizes phospholipids
    - It hinders membrane solidifaction at lower temps
    - It also prevents the membrane from become too fluid at high temps

![](https://i.imgur.com/DpmxpUP.png)

### Plasma Membrane Proteins 

- The plasma membrane is a mosaic of proteins dispersed within the bi-layer, with only the *hydrophilic regions exposed to water*

![](https://i.imgur.com/z2QlVdN.png)

- Proteins determine most of the membrane's specific funcitons

#### Protein Functions

![](https://i.imgur.com/14zgzkC.png)

### Transport Across Plasma Membrane 

#### **Passive transport:**
- Ions and polar molecules enter the cell through trnasport proteins in the membrane
- Facilitated diffusion does *not* require ATP for function
- from high to low concentration (with gradient)
![](https://i.imgur.com/vO0BXFM.png)

#### **Active Transport:**

- Against the concentration gradient
- Energy input required (e.g. ATP)

![](https://i.imgur.com/72P36Rn.png)

--- 

Membrane transport proteins generally...
- Span the bilayer
- may provide a hydrophilic channel across the membrane
- allow for passage of select solutes across the membrane
- some transport proteins shuttle substances across the mebrane through a *change in shape (receptor)*

> Aquaporins are a great example!!
> They conduct water in and out of the cell, preventing the passage of charged species.
> 3 billion water molecules flow through them each second, jesus fucking christ lol

### Membrane Enzyme Proteins

![](https://i.imgur.com/3g3WGvB.png)

- Spans the lipid bi-layer
- *lowers the activation energy* of the reaction, thereby making thousands or even millions of times faster than they would without a catalyst
- Enzymes are highly specific to their substrates (lock and key)
- When substrate binding occurs, enzymes undergo a conformational shift that orients the substrates so that they are more reactive

### Membrane Receptor Proteins (signial transduction) 

![](https://i.imgur.com/M9ZSVw1.png)

- Spans the lipid bilayer
- May have a *binding site* with a specific shape that fits a molecule like a hormone or peptide
- The external signaling molecule may cause a *conformational* (shape) change of receptor protein
- **Result:** message is passed into the cell

### Membrane Glycoproteins: *cell cell recognition*
![](https://i.imgur.com/sWagqXy.png)

- Some glycoproteins serve as identification tags
- specifically recognised by membrane proteins of other cells

#### Joining

Various Glycoproteins used as a bridge to join a cell to the surrounding environment:
- Cell adhesion molecules
- Vinculin (adhesion to b actin, a type of filament-y thing)
- VCAM (vascular)
- ICAM (intercellular)
- PECAMX

![](https://i.imgur.com/aS33S9O.png)

> HIV is a great example! they have lil receptors that bind to the entry of cells that let em in



### Endocytosis

a type of active transport that moves particles, such as large molecules, parts of cells, and even whole cells, into a cell

Transport *to* the cell - essentially!

#### Phagocytosis

- In phagocytosis, cell engulfs a particle
- Pseudopodia wrap around the particle, packing it within a membranous sac called a 'food vacuole'

![](https://i.imgur.com/JEEJlxn.png)

Phagocytosis be nommin

#### Receptor-mediated endocytosis

- Only specific substances need this
- receptor proteins clustered in regions of the membrane called "coated" fits (lined on the cytoplasmic side by fuzzy layer of coat proteins)

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZWFJXDV.png)



### Exocytosis

is a type of ‘bulk’ active transport in which materials are transported from inside-out the cell in membrane-bound vesicles that fuse with the plasmalemma

Transport *out* of the cell!

- Intercellular vesicle (membrane bounded sphere) moves to the plasma membrane
- Vesicular membrane fuses with plasma membrane
- Releasing the vesicle content outside the cell

![](https://i.imgur.com/RTMTlGN.png)

## Nucleus 

### Structure, Shape, and Function of Nucleus

3 main functions:
- Storage and maintenance of (most of) cell's genetic information.
    - 99% of genetic material is contained in the nucleus, 1% is extranuclear
- Control of gene expression through *transcription*
- Regulation of protein synthesis machinery through:
    - Synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
    - assembly of ribosomes (in the nucleus)

![](https://i.imgur.com/8QdqROo.png)

### Nuclear Envelope
- The nuclear envelope (NE) consists of *two lipid bilayer membranes*
- *inner* nuclear membrane (INM)
- *outer* nuclear membrane (ONM)
- Perinuclear space in between (approx. 10-50 nm wide, quite smol)
>
- Outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER)
- NE was *nuclear pores* that allow materials to move between cytosol and nucleus 
- Intermediate filament proteins (lamins) form a structure called the *nuclear lamina* on the inner aspect of the inner nuclear membrane
- *nuclear lamina* gives structural support to the nuclear

![](https://i.imgur.com/AUmJXoc.png)

### Nuclear Pores

- Double membrnae surrounding the nucleus contains protein channels (nuclear pores)
- Nuclear pores: inner and outer membranes fused together
- Function: transit mof materials (proteins, RNAs) between the nucleus and cytoplasm

![](https://i.imgur.com/kk7Gxv3.png)

> 3000 nuclear pores on average per cell

### Nuclear envelope assembly
- In higher eukaryotes, the nuclear nevelope disassembles early in mitosis and reassembles later around the daughter chromosomes

![](https://i.imgur.com/3Lo0NpY.png)

### Nuclear Lamina
> This is how the nucleus maintains its shape!

- The nucleus is usually spherical or oval in shape
- The inner side of the nuclear envelope is lined by the *nuclear lamina*
- *Lamin filaments* maintain the nuclear shape

![](https://i.imgur.com/1qkwYJ8.png)

- The famins also anchors interphase chromatin at nuclear periphery

The nuclear lamina is incredibly important! if it's altered, then the shape of the nucleus is altered. that will further cause an alteration in gene expression

### Storage of Hereditary Information

DNA Double helix model! :D

DNA is a double helix formed by base pairs attached to a sugar-phosphate backbone

![](https://i.imgur.com/vU8GwWU.png)

Complementary base pairing (with hydrogen bonds!):

Adenine = Thymine, Guanine = Cytosine

### Roadmap to the Double Helix (1953)

- Chargaff (late 40s): base pairing rules
- Franklin (1952): X-ray diffraction
- Watson & Crick (1953): 3D model building

### DNA Packaging 

Each cell is about a hundredth of a millimeter across, and it packs around 2m of DNA inside of it!

![](https://i.imgur.com/jk5mkMv.png)

- DNA is organised into discrete units called *chromosomes*
- Each chromosome is *one loooong DNA molecule associated with proteins*
- Some of the proteins help to coil the DNA and packge it within the nucleus
- the DNA-protein complex is called chromatin
- A gene is a length of DNA that codes for a specific protein

![](https://i.imgur.com/zNFvLKD.png)

#### What is Chromatin? 

Chromatin is the material that makes up a chromosome!

- The major proteins in chromatin are proteins called histones (packaging elements for the DNA)
- the Chromatin condense DNA by wrapping and re-wrapping the DNA in a very tight coil (called chromatin!)

![](https://i.imgur.com/o9a9AWt.png)

#### Nucleusomes

Nucleosomes are segments of DNA wrapped around 8 histone proteins!
- 2 copies of histones allow for DNA to be organized and packed in the nucleus

![](https://i.imgur.com/en53Y58.png)

### The Nucleolus

- This is the site of rRNA synthesis, rRNA processing, and assembly of ribosomal subunits

![](https://i.imgur.com/JUlUk3S.png)

#### The Size of the Nucleolus

The size of the nucelolus depends on ribosomal requirements of the type of cell in which they are found

So, a large nucleolus is needed for cells that prouce large amounts of protein (e.g. secreting cells like the pancreatic cells)

### Ribosomes

- Ribosomal RNA and protein complexes
- Carries out protein synthesis
- High rates of protein synthesis in a cell means lots of ribosomes

#### Two types of ribosomes:

1. Free in the cytoplasm
2. Bound to the Endoplasmic Reticulum (the hangy bois outside the nucleus)

- Protins made in *free ribosomes* function in the cytoplasm
- Proteins made in *bound ribosomes* usually destined for instertion into membranes or organelles for secretion

## Mitochondria

- It's the powerhouse of the cell!
- It's semi-autonomous, meaning it can grow and reproduce within the cell!
- Mitochondrial DNA - several genes (coding for only ~1% of all mitochondrial proteins)

### Mitochondria Internal Components
1. Internal membrane space - narrow region between the inner and outer membranes
2. Mitochondrial matrix - enclosed by the inner membrane

![](https://i.imgur.com/HGyodY0.png)

### Mitochondria Function

The mitochondria converts energy contained in food to forms that the cell can use (ATP!)

It primarily converts the energy contained in bonds of a glucose molecule into ATP, discrete usable unit of energy store. They turn sugars, fats, and other fuels into ATP with the help of oxygen

The mitochondria also has a *regulatory role*, for example in programmed cell death

### Where is the Mitochondria found?

- Mitochondria are found in nearly all eukaryotic cells
- Most cells have hundreds/thoussands of mitochondria
    - Mitochondria number is correleated with the level of metabolic activity
    - Motile of contractile cells have proportionately more mitochondria per volume than less active cells (muscule cells go brr)

### Mitochondrial Proteins

- Mitochondrial membrane proteins are *not* made by the Endoplasmic Reticulum
    - they're made by free ribosomes in the cytosol or ribosomes in the mitochondria!

![](https://i.imgur.com/ytl8fAh.png)

### Mitochondrial Inheritance

Only inherited from the mother's side

![](https://i.imgur.com/pAo88fF.png)

For example, if the mother is affected by a ribosomal disorder, all her kids will be too.

## Cellular Respiration in Mitochondria
Mitochondrial Matrix - many different enzymes, mitochondrial DNA and ribosomes

Some metabolic steps of cellular respiration catalyzed by enzymes in the mitochondrial matrix

![](https://i.imgur.com/q9szI9w.png)

*Other proteins* that fcuntion in respiration, including enzymes that make ATP - embedded into the inner membrane

Invaginations of the inner mitochondrial - large surface area - enhanced the productivity of cellular respiration

![](https://i.imgur.com/UxH74xo.png)

### Three Stages of cellular respiration

- Glycolysis (The breaking down of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate in the cytoplasm)
- The Citric Acid Cycle (completes the breakdown of glucose in the mitochondrial matrix (in eukaryotes))
- Oxidative phosphorylation (accounts for most of the ATP synthesis),(takes place across inner mitochondrial membrane)

> I should really go back into detail about the steps in ATP respiration, but ehhhhh no
