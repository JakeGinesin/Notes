# Lect 2, Nucleus

> Once again, this document isn't the full notes from the lecture - Just personal notes. I plan on just paying attention to the lecture and not writing notes till after

> The teacher provides her full slideshows on brightspace (our online learning platform thing) so i don't need to take notes in class

> Nucleus is yosra's favorite organelle (confirmed)

## Personal 

- Prob should go back on chem a bit more, specifically with bond types and structures (hydrogen bonds)
- Nucleolus vs Nucleus


## Vocab I need to process more

- Nuclear activity (in the content of a nucleus) - Ribosome siht
- Pinocytosis - Cells taking in fluids (cell drinking!)
- mtDNA (extranuclear DNA) - Mitochondrial (mt) DNA
- transcription - Information from DNA is copied into a new molecule of mRna
- Muclear lamina (TEM) - Structure near inner nuclear membrane and peripheral chromatin (tons of dna)
- Perinuclear space - Another word for between inner and outer membranes
- Higher eukaryotes - Organisms composed of one or more cells containing visibly evident nuclei and organelles
- Intermediate Protein filaments
- Interphase Chromatin - chromatin in between stuffs
- Nuclear periphery
- normal murine myocyte - muscle cell from a healthy mouse lmao wtf(???)
- murine - mouse
- X-Ray diffraction
- Chromatin
