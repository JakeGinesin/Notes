# Lect 3, Mitochondria

> I have the first lab today :D 
> I'll assume I'll take notes on here for that, i don't know for sure tho. 

## Personal/General Notes

### Personal

- Mastering biology go brrrr (fuck chem/mastering chem)
- Wtf there's so many mitochondrias per cell (1000-2000)

### Practical

- Bring lab coat, pencil/notebook, and calculator to labs
- Download lab manual pdf
- online quiz after

### General

> Here's a picture of the mitochondria!

- Glycolysis is splitting sugars over many steps with 10 enzymes, and occurs in the cytoplasm
- Lmaooo wtf is the krebs cycle
- 1 glucose -> 38 ATP


## Vocab I don't know lol
- Cellular respiration
- Citric acid cycle
- Oxidative Phopshorylation
- Mitochondrial Hereditary Lineage
- Motile/Contractile cells
- Mitochondrial Matrix
- Redox
- Aerobic vs Anaerobic
- Mitochondrial Matrix
- Pyruvate
- Phosphorlation
- Cristae
- Chemiosmosis
