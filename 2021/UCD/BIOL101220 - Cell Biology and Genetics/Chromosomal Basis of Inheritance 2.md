# Chromosomal Basis of Inheritance pt 2

## Personal Notes
- X chromosome is way bigger than Y, X has way more genes
- Mendel looked at one trait, morgan looked at two traits at the same time
- homo = same, hetro = different

## Vocab I don't understand 
- linked genes = genes that tend to get inherited together
- Non-recombination vs recombination (sorting of alleles into new combinations)
- single crossover
- nondisjunction
- monosomic = zygote only has one copy of a chromosome
- trisomic = zygote has three cpies ofa particular chromosome
