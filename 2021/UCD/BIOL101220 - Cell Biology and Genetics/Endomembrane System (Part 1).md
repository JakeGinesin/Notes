# Lect 5, Endomembrane System (Part 1)

> Imagine doing a PhD in bio ._.


## General/Personal Notes

~~So, does the endomembrane literally contain everything? I'm genuinely confused~~

Waitt, nvm. It's the shit spewing out of the nucleus

- Woah, 50% of the total membrane of the cell is in the rough ER
- **Endoplasmic**: "within"
- **Reticulum**: "Little net"
- How does the smoth endoplasmic reticulum store shit and filter shit?

~~Golgi == Pancakes nom~~

## Vocab I don't know lmao

- Protein trafficking
