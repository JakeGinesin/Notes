## UCD.md

### Classes I've taken/attended at UCD (University of College Dublin):

> Keep in mind I didn't make digital notes for all these classes. Notes for Geology, College Writing, Discrete Maths, and Multivariable are physical. Maybe I'll type them up eventually. 

- College Writing (SCI10020)
- Music In Ireland (MUS20610)
- Cell Biology and Genetics (BIOL10120)
- Multivariable Calculus (MATH20070)
- Discovering Ireland's Geology (GEOL20220)
- Data Mining (COMP40370)
- Object-Oriented Programming (COMP30070)
- Data Science with Python (COMP30760)
- Computer Engineering (EEEN20010)
- Machine Learning with Python (COMP47750)
- Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science (COMP20110)

> EDIT 10/20/2021: I figured out that it's possible to [encorperate LaTeX into Github markdown](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35498525/latex-rendering-in-readme-md-on-github). I'll use LaTeX notation to _attempt_ to add Discrete Math and Calculus notes to my repo.

### Mathematical Equation Rendering

Turns out Github does not support the rendering of Mathematical notation :<

There are workarounds, though. You can change LaTeX into Github MD formatting using [this tool](https://jsfiddle.net/8ndx694g/)
