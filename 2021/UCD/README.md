- Music In Ireland (MUS20610)
- Cell Biology and Genetics (BIOL10120)
- Multivariable Calculus (MATH20070)
- Discovering Ireland's Geology (GEOL20220)
- Data Mining (COMP40370)
- Object-Oriented Programming (COMP30070)
- Data Science with Python (COMP30760)
- Computer Engineering (EEEN20010)

> EDIT 10/20/2021: I figured out that it's possible to [encorperate LaTeX into Github markdown](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35498525/latex-rendering-in-readme-md-on-github). I'll use LaTeX notation to _attempt_ to add Discrete Math and Calculus notes to my repo.
